              When I was 8 I fell in love with the best sport ther is: rugby. And that is not just my opinion, it's a fact, sorry.
              I played for almost 9 years in the same team and I stopped only for physical reason, indeed my love for it is still 
              intact (although is not easy to watch, being an Italy fan).
            </p>
            <p>
              I did not stop doing sports though, I played ultimate for a year after that. Starting the university made me stop for
              a while with team sports, since I needed a more flexible approach, as I was adjusting to the new situation.

              I found the perfect solution when I started climbing, and I was positively surprised by it. I started in the gym and then
              I decided to also try actual rock climbing outdoor, and now it has been almost 5 year from when I started and I still enjoy
               as the first time. Outdoor my friends and I mostly do what is called bouldering, but we hae tried also some more classic rope
               climbing.

              While I was trying all these different sports I also had a constant passion in snowboarding, that I had the opportunity to start
              practicing from a young age. Together with that I also really enjoy going on holiday in the mountains, in particular in the amzing
              Dolomites.

              Lately I have also decided to get a scuba diver certificate, since I always enjoyed diving underwater, and I hope in the future
              to be able to keep pursuing this passion, in order to get more advance licenses.
