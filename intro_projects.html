          <p>It is an implementation of the Depth First algorithm for the generation of mazes. The basic idea is that we move randomly in unvisited cells removing walls, until all the cells are visited.</p>
          <p>Also, it is a very nice screen saver.</p>

          <p>Simple simulation of a double pendulum. It is made such that the lower mass traces its path on the canvas, in order to show the chaotic nature of the system.</p>
          <p> It is also possible to change both masses and the length on the two pendula.</p>

          <p>Classical implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Only difference is that the world is a toroid, so the cells wrap around when they reach the border.
             For a description of this system you can check the <a class="linkini-inside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" >Wikipedia page</a>.

          <p>Really interesting behaviour with just a few simple rules, just let the ant wonder around for a bit and a pattern will emerge.
            <a class="linkini-inside" href="http://www.langtonant.com/" >Here</a> is possible to change a lot of parameters (that I may implement sooner or later).

          <p>One of the super classic examples for system with emergign behaviours. Each entity (boid) follow three rules:
            align with neighbours speed, go towards the center of mass of the neighbours and avoid collisions.  <a class="linkini-inside" href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" >Here</a>
            is the website of the creator of Boids with the rules and the main idea explained.

          <div class='snapshot'><a href="projects/voronoi/index.html" ><img src="images/voronoi.png" width="150"></a></div>
          <p>Algorithm used for the tessellation of space. The idea is to find the area around a given points such that all the points inside this
            area are closer to him than to any other point present on the surface. For a deeper explanation of efficients algorithms (which I did not followed), you can check the <a class="linkini-inside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" >Wikipedia page</a>.

          <div class='snapshot'><a href="projects/sandpiles/index.html" ><img src="images/sandpile.png" width="150"></a></div>
          <p>The simulation represents a sandpile: the basic idea is that you keep adding sand untill a threshold is reached and the sand is released in the adjacent cells. The process is iteratively repeated.
            A better and more detailed explanation is <a class="linkini-inside" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg" >here</a> in the Numberphile video.

          <div class='snapshot'><a href="projects/gravity/index.html" ><img src="images/gravity.png" width="150"></a></div>
          <p>This simple simulation represents the motion of satellites influenced by the gravitational force of another object. To keep everything very basic the satellites only feel the 'attractor' force, and they
            do not interact with each other. I am giving each satellites random initial velocities, and the starting position is on a circle around the attractor.
